This is work from a youtuber. If you want to find the original person who created this search up "youtube no rossetta minecraft"  
I haved edited this so you can launch minecraft without having a legal minecraft account.  
If you have a legal account type this into your terminal while at this folder  
sh launch.sh "email" "password" "username" "amount of ram"  
If you dont have a legal account type in this  
sh launch.sh "a" "a" "username" "amount of ram"  

Some amounts of ram that are acceptable are   
"2g"  
"4g"  
"3g"  
I reccomend 3g as that is a good compromise in how mcuh you actually need and not using more than your computer can handle.
